Preface: I've been taking an interest in web development recently. Learning HTML, CSS, still working on JavaScript. I'm currently reading JavaScript & JQuery: Interactive Front-end Web Development. By Jon Duckett. I have read great things and looking forward to finishing this book. I'm definitely still learning and expanding my skills, but I have a fair understanding of Web development.

Question: I've recently been putting myself out there to see what happens, though I will admit I know that i still have much to learn in becoming a great programmer. I have been seeing a trend in the area where I live, Iowa City, that there are more postings from companies or business that are in need of Drupal or WordPress programmers.
